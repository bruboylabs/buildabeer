<h1>BuildA.Beer</h1>

BuildA.Beer is an online beer recipe designer that enables brewers to more easily make potentially complex recipes with a high confidence of what the outcome of their brew day will be.

Immediate goals of the designer are to increase user design and user experience, increase accuracy of calculations, and increase options and advice to brewers for a more successful brew day.

Future goals of the designer include but are not limited to: connect to automated brew systems and run commands through the recipe runner portion of the app; utilize modern artificial intelligence and a someday vast recipe library to advise brewers on how to build a better recipe.

BuildA.Beer is written using Ruby on Rails and Angular2+, published through Heroku.

Installation
1. Create an empty folder named 'opensource', navigate to it
2. Clone the repo though 'git clone https://github.com/buildabeer/buildabeer.git'
3. More instruction is certainly needed here, however my computer is in the process of being rebuilt and refuses to let me go through the steps... Sorry!
4. Overall: You will have to install the latest ruby and rails, alone w/ the angular 5.
5. Then you will have to run through bundle updates on the rails server and angular front end to pull the latest gems/packages.
6. If all of that goes well, you can run 'rails s' to start the rails server and 'ng s' to start the angular front end.
7. The front end will run on localhost:4200, the rails server will run on localhost:3000
